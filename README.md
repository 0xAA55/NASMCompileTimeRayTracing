# NASM Compile-Time Ray-Tracing Demo
Ray-tracing rendering technique achieved by using NASM macros. Rendering is done during compile time. The compiler outputs a BMP file.

# How to compile
## Prerequisite
First, you need the [NASM](https://nasm.us/) compiler. To install the NASM compiler under Linux you can use `apt-get`, `yum`, `pacman`, etc.

The source code was designed to be compiled by using `makefile` under `bash` in order to compile the file concurrently. If you don't have the environment, simply running `nasm raytrace.asm -o raytrace.bmp` to compile if you have `nasm` available.

The NASM compiler here isn't used for compiling machine codes. It's used to generate a BMP file struct directly, and it renders the scene during compiling.

## Concurrent compiling and memory usage
During compiling/rendering, there will be a huge amount of RAM consumed by the compiler. You have to check out the first few lines of `makefile` to adjust the configurations.

Pay attention to the option `SLICES` and `PIECES` of `makefile`, it's used for the ability to run multiple NASM compiler together to produce the scene quickly, and the option `PIECES` and `SLICES` are used to split the picture into small blocks. The small blocks can be compiled concurrently. Using the `-j` option of `makefile` specifies the maximum count of the running processes of the compiler. But since the compilation consumes huge memory, more `PIECES` and `SLICES` with a lower `-j` number is suggested. **Note** that `YRES` must be integer times of `SLICES` and `XRES` must be integer times of `PIECES` to produce a correct BMP file.

For example, set the resolution to 640x480, and set `PIECES` to 64, set `SLICES` to 48, then run `make -j12`, the scene will be generated by compiling some small 10x10 parts concurrently by running 12 compiler processes together. After all of the parts were generated, the compiler creates the scene out of the parts. The usage of memory is expected to lower than 32GB.

## Preview
When compiling is slowly proceeding, it's able to check the preview of the scene by running `make preview`. The script tries to composite the picture by concatenating the pieces and create a picture file out of them. You can then view `preview.bmp` to have a quick peek of the rendering picture.
